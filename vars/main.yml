# vars file for ansible-role-template

# This file should only contain vars that you wouldn't want overridden.
# Most vars should probably go into ./defaults/main.yml
# This is due to variable precedence in Ansible. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#understanding-variable-precedence
